# Going

This is a dumping ground for tutorials and other nonsense coming out of learning to code with the Go programming language.

Get it? Go ... ing?

## How To Going

This repo is a collection of directories, each representing a tutorial/ed-platform that I've used or a learning project.

Eventually I'll return to this README and others deeper in the folders to fill them out with notes for solidifying my learning.

And it'd be nice to restructure all the code so that running the assorted apps will give you informative or useful output...

But until then, just expect you can `go run cmd/main.go` in most of these folders and you should get some kind of output.

That output just might not be very useful without also checking out the associated code.
